# Custom Exceptions in C#👌👌🕶🕶
*The sample code will save an inventory item object, but not allow the save if the item’s Name or Country property is an empty string, or the Quantity property is a negative number. We’ll do one way with throwing exceptions.Keep in mind, you normally only want to throw an exception if something unexpected is happening. Common situations, like a user entering an invalid value, may better be handled without exceptions. In general, throwing an exception should be your last choice. We have written a custom exception with the three custom constructors provided by system.Exception class.*

In **.NET**, an exception is an object that inherits from the **System.Exception class**. An exception is thrown from an area of code where a problem has occurred. We have explicitly shown this in our **inventory App** example. Feel free to explore!👓✌

## Technologies used
* .NET 6 🎗
* C#👓😎
* Visual Studio 2022.

## Programming Paradigm
Object oriented Programming in C#(we used constructors, methods, classes and fields)

**NOTE:**This application is subject to further improvements and changes...cheers!👓😃👌🤷‍♀️
